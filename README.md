# odin-recipes
The current project is making a recipe page with html, and later css.
I am going to demonstrate the knowledge on html that I have aqcuired so far.
It will have the main index page, and some recipes with their required links to view them.
I do think it will be a little difficult remembering alot of the stuff that I have learned so far, but I think that I will be able to do this project decently.

The html part ended up being pretty simple, but I am sure that will change once I come back with CSS. I will update this once I do.

Another update. Came back and fiddled with the basics of CSS on the site. Once I get better I am going to come back, and make this site
way better, because it's the first real thing I've worked on.
