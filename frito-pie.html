         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Frito pie is a quick dish anyone can make quick. I do the method that is fast, and low effort so you can expect
            for it to be made with cheaper less complex chili ingredients.
         </p>
        
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fritos</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Homemade chili, or canned chili</li>
            <li>Any other condiments or veggies you want to add yourself</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>First you want to get your chili cooked, or heated up. I use canned chili so I just have to open the can, and heat it up on the stove. </li>
            <li>Once you heat up your chili you are going to need to pour your fritos into a bowl.</li>
            <li>After that you are going to need to put your shredded cheese on top of it.</li>
            <li>Now pour your chili on top of the fritos and cheese then stir.</li>
            <li>Once your frito pie is all mixed up you can now eat it and enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
